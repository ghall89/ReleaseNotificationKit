## About

A Swift package for getting the latest release from a GitHub repo and presenting a download link.

Disclaimer: This package is something I built for my own apps for fun, and provided with no documentation. I do not recommend this for use in your own projects, and instead reccomend something like [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org).
